# Project Overview

This project is a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates a machine learning model for image classification using the MNIST dataset. The notebook includes code for training a neural network model and evaluating its performance on a test dataset. Additionally, it includes code for training a support vector machine (SVM) model and evaluating its performance.

The project utilizes the PyTorch and scikit-learn libraries for implementing the neural network and SVM models, respectively. The MNIST dataset consists of grayscale images of handwritten digits, and the goal is to classify each image into the correct digit category.

# Steps to Run the Project

To run this project, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the project repository to your local machine.

```

   git clone <repository-url>
   cd my_project
```


2. Create a virtual environment for the project.
    ```
    python3 -m venv venv
    
    ```
3. Activate the virtual environment.
     - on macOS abd Linux:
        ```
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```
    - on Windows
        ```
        .\venv\Scripts\activate
        ```
4. Install the required packages by running the following command in the terminal:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
5. Start Jupyter Notebook by running the following command in the terminal:
   ```
   jupyter notebook
   ```
6. In the Jupyter Notebook interface, navigate to the project directory and open the Jupyter Notebook file.
7. Run the cells in the notebook sequentially to execute the code and see the results.

By following these steps, you will be able to run the project and explore the implementation of the neural network and SVM models for image classification using the MNIST dataset.
